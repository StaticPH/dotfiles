### Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored, except for the special section header lines, "#info", "#var", "#echo-area".
### A default key binding may be disabled by overriding it with the action "invalid".
### The order in which key bindings are defined in the ".infokey" file is not important, except that the command summary produced by the "get-help-window" command only displays the FIRST key that is bound to each command.

#info
### Lines in this section take the following form:
###   STRING whitespace ACTION [ whitespace [ # comment ] ] newline
### Where STRING is a key sequence and ACTION is the name of an Info command to invoke.
### The characters in STRING are interpreted literally or prefixed by a caret ('^') to indicate a control character. 
### Recognized backslash-escaped sequences are:
###    \b    Backspace    \e     Escape (ESC)
###    \n    Newline      \r     Return
###    \t    Tab          \kx    Delete
###    \ku   Up Arrow     \kd    Down Arrow
###    \kl   Left Arrow   \kr    Right Arrow
###    \kU   Page Up      \kD    Page Down
###    \kh   HOME         \ke    END
###    \mX   Meta-X where X is any character as described above.
### Other backslash-escaped characters are taken literally. Characters which must be preceeded by a backslash thus include the caret, space, tab (if not using \t), and backslash.

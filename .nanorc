## Color setup
##
## Format:
##
## syntax "short description" ["filename regex" ...]
##
## The "none" syntax is reserved; specifying it on the command line is
## the same as not having a syntax at all.  The "default" syntax is
## special: it takes no filename regexes, and applies to files that
## don't match any other syntax's filename regexes.
##
## color foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
## or
## icolor foreground,background "regex" ["regex"...]
##
## "color" will do case sensitive matches, while "icolor" will do case
## insensitive matches.
##
## Valid colors: white, black, red, blue, green, yellow, magenta, cyan.
## For foreground colors, you may use the prefix "bright" to get a
## stronger highlight.
##
## To use multi-line regexes, use the start="regex" end="regex"
## [start="regex" end="regex"...] format.
##
## If your system supports transparency, not specifying a background
## color will use a transparent color.  If you don't want this, be sure
## to set the background color to black or white.
##
## If you wish, you may put your syntaxes in separate files.  You can
## make use of such files (which can only include "syntax", "color", and
## "icolor" commands) as follows:
##
## include "/path/to/syntax_file.nanorc"
##
## Unless otherwise noted, the name of the syntax file (without the
## ".nanorc" extension) should be the same as the "short description"
## name inside that file.  These names are kept fairly short to make
## them easier to remember and faster to type using nano's -Y option.
##
## All regexes should be extended regular expressions.

############## Nanorc syntax highlighting
## It's far from perfect, but it's plenty enough for my needs
syntax "nanorc" "\.nanor[c]?$"
color blue "^(\<((un|)(set|bind))\>)"
color yellow "\\<|\\>"
color magenta "^(\<(extend|)syntax|header|magic|include\>)"
color brightred "[|]"
color brightgreen "#.*$"
color brightblue "^[i]?color "
color cyan "\<(start|end)\>="
color brightblack "^(\<comment|tabgives\>)"
color green "^(\<formatter|linter\>)"
color normal "\\\\<|\\\\>"

## Paint the interface elements of nano.  These are examples;

# set titlecolor brightwhite,blue
# set statuscolor brightwhite,green
# set errorcolor brightwhite,red
# set selectedcolor brightwhite,magenta
# set stripecolor ,yellow

## In root's .nanorc you might want to use:
# set titlecolor brightwhite,magenta
# set statuscolor brightwhite,magenta
# set errorcolor brightwhite,red

# set keycolor brightmagenta
# set functioncolor magenta

## Key bindings.
## See nanorc(5) (section REBINDING KEYS) for more details on this.
###############################################################

## The <Ctrl+Delete> keystroke deletes the word to the right of the cursor.
## On some terminals the <Ctrl+Backspace> keystroke produces ^H, which is
## the ASCII character for backspace, so it is bound by default to the
## backspace function.  The <Backspace> key itself produces a different
## keycode, which is hard-bound to the backspace function.  So, if you
## normally use <Backspace> for backspacing and not ^H, you can make
## <Ctrl+Backspace> delete the word to the left of the cursor with:
# bind ^H cutwordleft main	OR	bind ^H chopwordleft main	depending on your version of nano

## If you would like nano to have keybindings that are more "usual",
## such as ^O for Open, ^F for Find, ^H for Help, and ^Q for Quit,
## then uncomment these:
#bind ^Q exit all
#bind ^H help all
#bind ^H exit help
#bind ^F whereis all
#bind ^G findnext all
#bind ^B wherewas all
#bind ^D findprevious all
#bind ^R replace main
#bind ^W writeout main
#bind ^O insert main
#unbind ^V all
#unbind ^Y all
#bind M-X flipnewbuffer all
#bind ^X cut all
#bind ^C copy all
#bind ^V paste all
#bind ^P curpos main
#bind ^T gotoline main
#bind ^T gotodir browser
#bind ^Y speller main
#unbind ^K all
#unbind ^U all
#bind M-R redo main
#bind ^U undo main
#bind ^E redo main
#unbind M-J main
#unbind M-T main
#set multibuffer

unbind M-E main # stop using Alt/Meta+E to redo actions
unbind M-X all # prevent disabling nohelp everywhere; it should really be enabled at all times
unbind M-C main # prevent disabling constantshow in the main view; it should really be enabled at all times
unbind M-H main # prevent disabling smarthome in the main view; it should really be enabled at all times
unbind ^B main # free up Ctrl+b for use of findbracket action

bind ^H chopwordleft all # delete word to left of cursor with Ctrl+H (Ctrl+Backspace)
bind ^B findbracket main # Find a matching bracket with Ctrl+B
bind M-Y redo main # use Alt/Meta+Y to redo actions
bind M-U undo main # use Alt/Meta+U to undo actions

##### I wish these worked :(
# bind ^Space complete all # attempt word completion with Ctrl+Space
# bind ^Enter complete all # attempt word completion with Ctrl+Enter
# bind Sh-space pageup help # press shift+Space to scroll up a page in the help view
# bind ^PgUp prevbuf main # switch to the previous file passed to nano with Ctrl+PageUp
# bind ^PgDn nextbuf main # switch to the next file passed to nano with Ctrl+PageUp

# bind ^{ prevblock main	# move up a text-block with Ctrl+]		may also work with Ctrl+Up
# bind ^} nextblock main	# move down a text-block with Ctrl+[	may also work with Ctrl+Down
